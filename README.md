NOTE: I chose to simply add onto my previous graph rather than create all new .h and .c files.

# List.h
Header file containing the function prototypes for the list ADT.

# List.c
Contains bodies of each function for the list ADT.

# Graph.h
Header file containing the function prototypes for the graph ADT.

# Graph.c
Contains bodies of each function for the graph ADT.

# GraphTest.c
Contains "scrapwork." Utilized to test the functions during program creation.

# FindComponents.c
Reads data from input file and uses it to create a graph. Processes the graph and prints its adjacency list and strongly connected components to an output file.
